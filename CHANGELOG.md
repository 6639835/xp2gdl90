  - **Impact**: Traffic and ownship near equator now correctly reported
  
- **Fixed Aircraft Existence Detection**: Improved logic to properly identify active aircraft
  - **Issue**: Stationary aircraft (parked, taxiing slowly) incorrectly marked as non-existent
  - **Old Logic**: `if (speed == 0.0f && track == 0.0f && vs == 0.0f) { active = false; }`
  - **New Logic**: Use position validity as primary indicator, velocity as secondary check
  - **Impact**: Parked aircraft at gates and slow taxi operations now properly tracked

#### 📡 **GDL-90 Specification Compliance Improvements**

## [1.0.7] - 2025-09-04

### 🔧 **Critical GDL-90 Specification Compliance Fixes**

#### 🛩️ **Zero Vertical Speed Handling Fix**
- **Fixed Critical Bug**: Corrected zero vertical speed encoding per GDL-90 specification Section 3.5.1.8
  - **Issue**: Zero vertical speed (0 FPM level flight) was incorrectly encoded as 0x800 ("no data available")
  - **Spec Requirement**: 0x000 represents 0 FPM, 0x800 reserved for "no vertical velocity information available"
  - **Root Cause**: Logic checked `if (data.vs != 0.0)` treating legitimate zero values as missing data
  - **Fix**: Changed to check dataref availability `if (vs_dataref != nullptr)` instead of value comparison
  - **Impact**: Level flight now correctly reports zero vertical speed instead of "no data"
  - **Compliance**: Ensures proper GDL-90 specification adherence per Table 8

#### 🎯 **Dynamic Miscellaneous Field Implementation**
- **Enhanced Compliance**: Implemented dynamic miscellaneous field per GDL-90 specification Table 9
  - **Issue**: Miscellaneous field hardcoded to value `9` regardless of aircraft state
  - **Spec Requirement**: Field must reflect actual Air/Ground state, report type, and track type
  - **Implementation**: Dynamic field construction based on real aircraft parameters
    - Bit 3: Air/Ground state (0=Ground, 1=Airborne) from ground detection dataref
    - Bit 2: Report status (0=Updated, 1=Extrapolated) 
    - Bits 1-0: Track type (01=True Track Angle per spec)
  - **Data Source**: Added `sim/flightmodel2/gear/on_ground` dataref (int[10] array)
  - **Impact**: Accurate aircraft state reporting for both ownship and traffic targets

### 🛡️ **Security and Code Quality Fixes**

  - **Files Modified**: `src/xp2gdl90.cpp` (lines 648, 667)
  - **Impact**: Eliminates compiler warnings and potential runtime issues

#### 🧹 **Unused Variable Cleanup**
- **Code Quality**: Eliminated unused variable warnings in conditional compilation blocks
  - **Issue**: `last_ui_update` variable declared outside `#if HAVE_IMGUI` block

## [1.0.6] - 2025-08-28

### 🚨 **Critical Bug Fixes**

#### 🛩️ **Traffic Coordinate Duplication Fix**
- **Fixed Major Bug**: Resolved issue where all traffic aircraft reported identical coordinates
  - **Issue**: X-Plane individual position datarefs (`plane##_lat`, `plane##_lon`) returned ownship coordinates for non-existent aircraft

  - **Behavior**: Array datarefs correctly returned 0.0 for non-existent aircraft, but individual datarefs returned ownship position
  - **Fix**: Added aircraft validation in `update_traffic_targets()` to skip aircraft with no activity
  - **Validation Logic**: Aircraft with speed=0.0, track=0.0, and vertical_speed=0.0 are considered non-existent
  - **Impact**: Eliminates duplicate traffic reports at ownship location, ensures accurate traffic positioning
  - **Files Modified**: `src/xp2gdl90.cpp` (added validation logic in traffic update loop)

#### 🎯 **Traffic Report Accuracy**
