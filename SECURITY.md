## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions of XP2GDL90:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

**Note**: Only the latest stable release receives security updates. Users are strongly encouraged to update to the latest version.

## Security Considerations

### Network Communication

XP2GDL90 broadcasts flight data over UDP networks. This presents several security considerations:

- **Unencrypted Data**: GDL-90 protocol transmits data in plaintext
- **Network Exposure**: UDP broadcasts can be intercepted on local networks
- **Denial of Service**: Malformed network requests could potentially affect plugin stability
- **IP Address Configuration**: Default localhost configuration limits exposure

### Plugin Architecture

As an X-Plane plugin, XP2GDL90 operates with the following security characteristics:

- **X-Plane Integration**: Direct access to flight simulator data through X-Plane SDK
- **Native Code**: C++ implementation with direct system access
- **Memory Management**: Manual memory management requires careful bounds checking
- **System Resources**: Network socket creation and UDP transmission capabilities

### Data Exposure

The plugin transmits the following types of data:

- **Aircraft Position**: Latitude, longitude, altitude
- **Flight Data**: Speed, heading, vertical speed
- **Traffic Information**: Positions of nearby aircraft
- **System Status**: Heartbeat and operational status

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities.

### How to Report

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security issues through one of these channels:

1. **Email**: Send details to `security@[your-domain]` (if available)
2. **Private GitHub Issue**: Contact maintainers privately
3. **Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting if available

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential security impact and affected components
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: 
  - Operating system and version
  - X-Plane version
  - Plugin version
  - Network configuration
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or demonstration (if applicable)
- **Suggested Fix**: Proposed solution (if you have one)

### Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports within:

- **Initial Response**: 48 hours
- **Triage and Assessment**: 7 days
- **Fix Development**: 30 days (depending on severity)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and users have time to update

### Coordinated Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Investigation**: We investigate the report privately
2. **Fix Development**: Develop and test fixes without public disclosure
3. **User Notification**: Notify users of security updates
4. **Public Disclosure**: Public disclosure after fix is available and adopted

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Installation Security

- **Download Sources**: Only download from official sources
- **File Integrity**: Verify file checksums when provided
- **Plugin Directory**: Install only in appropriate X-Plane plugin directories
- **File Permissions**: Ensure appropriate file permissions after installation

#### Network Security

- **Firewall Configuration**: Configure firewall rules appropriately
  ```
  Allow outbound UDP traffic on port 4000 (default)
  Restrict to localhost (127.0.0.1) unless remote access is needed
  ```

- **Network Monitoring**: Monitor network traffic for unexpected behavior
- **VPN Usage**: Consider VPN for remote network access scenarios

#### System Security

- **Regular Updates**: Keep X-Plane and plugin updated to latest versions
- **System Monitoring**: Monitor system logs for unusual activity
- **Antivirus**: Use updated antivirus software (though false positives may occur)

### For Developers

#### Code Security

- **Input Validation**: Validate all network input and X-Plane dataref values
- **Buffer Management**: Use safe string functions and bounds checking
- **Memory Safety**: Proper memory allocation and deallocation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all system calls

#### Build Security

- **Dependency Management**: Use trusted sources for dependencies
- **Build Environment**: Use clean build environments
- **Code Signing**: Sign binaries when possible (platform dependent)

## Network Security

### Default Configuration

The plugin ships with secure defaults:

- **Target IP**: `127.0.0.1` (localhost only)
- **Target Port**: `4000` (FDPRO standard)
- **Broadcast Scope**: Local machine only

### Network Threats

#### Potential Attack Vectors

1. **Data Interception**: 
   - **Risk**: Flight data visible on network
   - **Mitigation**: Use localhost or secure networks

2. **Man-in-the-Middle**: 
   - **Risk**: Data modification in transit
   - **Mitigation**: Trusted network environments only

3. **Denial of Service**: 
   - **Risk**: Network flooding or malformed packets
   - **Mitigation**: Rate limiting and input validation

4. **Information Disclosure**: 
   - **Risk**: Unintended data exposure
   - **Mitigation**: Minimal data transmission, localhost default

#### Network Hardening

- **Localhost Default**: Default configuration prevents external access
- **Firewall Rules**: Configure appropriate firewall restrictions
- **Network Segmentation**: Use isolated networks for flight simulation
- **Monitoring**: Log and monitor network connections

## Plugin Security

### X-Plane Integration

- **SDK Usage**: Follows X-Plane SDK security guidelines
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of system resources
- **Error Isolation**: Plugin errors don't affect X-Plane stability
- **Privilege Level**: Runs with X-Plane user privileges only

### Memory Safety

- **Buffer Protection**: All string operations use safe functions
- **Bounds Checking**: Array and buffer access validation
- **Stack Protection**: Compiler stack protection enabled where available
- **Heap Management**: Careful dynamic memory management

### System Resource Usage

- **Socket Management**: Proper socket creation and cleanup
- **File Access**: Limited to plugin directory and logging
- **Process Isolation**: No spawning of external processes
- **Network Limits**: Rate-limited network transmission

## Data Privacy

### Data Collection

The plugin does NOT collect:

- **Personal Information**: No user identification data
- **Telemetry**: No usage statistics or tracking
- **External Communication**: No communication outside configured targets

### Data Transmission

The plugin transmits only:

- **Flight Position Data**: As configured in X-Plane
- **Aircraft Status**: Standard flight parameters
- **Traffic Data**: Publicly available traffic information
- **System Heartbeat**: Operational status only

### Data Storage

- **No Persistent Storage**: Plugin doesn't store flight data
- **Memory Only**: All data exists only in memory during operation
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Data cleared when plugin stops

## Security Updates

### Update Policy

- **Critical Vulnerabilities**: Emergency releases within 48-72 hours
- **High Severity**: Patches within 1-2 weeks
- **Medium/Low Severity**: Included in next regular release
- **Security Advisories**: Published for all security-related updates

### Notification Channels

Users will be notified of security updates through:

- **README Updates**: Security information in documentation
- **Changelog**: Detailed security fix information

### Backward Compatibility

- **Security Fixes**: May break backward compatibility if necessary for security
- **Migration Path**: Clear upgrade instructions provided
- **Deprecation Notice**: Advance warning for insecure features
